# Database Integration for Form Submissions

## Overview
This implementation adds database storage for both the "Get Started" modal and Contact Form submissions, making it easy to manage leads and automate email campaigns.

## Database Schema

### Contacts Table
Stores all form submissions from both contact forms and get started modals:

- **Personal Info**: firstName, lastName, businessEmail
- **Company Info**: companyName, industry, companySize
- **Project Details**: currentChallenges, interestedServices, projectTimeline, budget, additionalInfo
- **Tracking**: source (contact_form/get_started), status, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Email Automation**: emailSent, emailSentAt

### Subscribers Table
Stores email newsletter subscriptions:

- **Contact Info**: email
- **Tracking**: source, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Email Automation**: welcomeEmailSent, welcomeEmailSentAt

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/contact
Handles contact form submissions with full validation and database storage.

### POST /api/subscribe
Handles newsletter subscriptions with duplicate checking.

### GET /api/admin/contacts
Returns paginated contacts with filtering and statistics (for admin dashboard).

### PATCH /api/admin/contacts
Updates contact status and email tracking.

## Admin Dashboard

Access at `/admin` to view and manage:

- **Dashboard Stats**: Total contacts, new leads, source breakdown
- **Contact Management**: View, filter, and update contact status
- **Email Tracking**: Mark emails as sent, track automation status
- **Lead Filtering**: Filter by status (new, contacted, qualified, closed) and source

## Forms Integration

### Contact Form (`/contact`)
- Captures comprehensive business information
- Validates all fields before submission
- Stores with source: "contact_form"
- Shows success message on completion

### Get Started Modal
- Multi-step form for better UX
- Progressive validation per step
- Stores with source: "get_started"
- Tracks completion through modal states

## Email Automation Ready

The database structure includes fields for email automation:

- `emailSent` / `emailSentAt` - Track outbound emails
- `welcomeEmailSent` / `welcomeEmailSentAt` - Track welcome sequences
- `status` field - Lead qualification tracking

## Next Steps for Email Automation

1. **Email Service Integration**: 
   - Add Resend, SendGrid, or Mailchimp
   - Set up automated welcome sequences
   - Create follow-up campaigns

2. **CRM Integration**:
   - Connect to HubSpot, Salesforce, or Pipedrive
   - Sync lead status and notes
   - Track communication history

3. **Enhanced Analytics**:
   - Conversion tracking
   - Source performance analysis
   - Email engagement metrics

## Database File Location

- Development: `prisma/dev.db` (SQLite)
- Production: Configure DATABASE_URL for PostgreSQL

## Viewing the Data

1. **Admin Dashboard**: Visit `/admin` for web interface
2. **Database Tools**: Use Prisma Studio with `npx prisma studio`
3. **Direct Access**: SQLite file can be opened with DB Browser or similar tools

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: The admin dashboard currently has no authentication. In production:

1. Add authentication middleware
2. Restrict admin routes to authorized users
3. Use environment variables for sensitive data
4. Consider API rate limiting
